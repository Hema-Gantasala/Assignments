# Name in Box

This pattern is to get a rectangular structured box with help of (+ - | and space) like below


       
       +-------------------------------+
       |                               |
       |                               |
       |                               |
       |                               |
       |                               | 
       |                               |
       +-------------------------------+
       
       
   And in the above box we need to print our name in the 2 and last row and leaving to spaces after the  name before reaching the edge(space occupied by name should be dynamic)
   
    
    
       +-------------------------------+
       |                               |
       |                               |
       |                               |
       |                               |
       |                         Hema  | 
       |                               |
       +-------------------------------+
